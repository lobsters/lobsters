### Lobsters Rails Project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lobsters/lobsters.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lobsters/lobsters)

This is the
[quite sad](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/6jz7tq/source_code_lobsters_a_hacker_news_clone_built/)
source code to the site operating at
[https://lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs).
It is a Rails 5 codebase and uses a SQL (MariaDB in production) backend for the database.

While you are free to fork this code and modify it (according to the [license](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/blob/master/LICENSE))
to run your own link aggregation website, this source code repository and bug
tracker are only for the site operating at [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/).
Please do not use the bug tracker for support related to operating your own
site unless you are contributing code that will also benefit [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/).

#### Contributing bugfixes and new features

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file.

#### Initial setup

* Install Ruby 2.3.

* Checkout the lobsters git tree from Github

         $ git clone git://github.com/lobsters/lobsters.git
         $ cd lobsters
         lobsters$

* Install Nodejs, needed (or other execjs) for uglifier

         Fedora: sudo yum install nodejs
         Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install nodejs
         OSX: brew install nodejs

* Run Bundler to install/bundle gems needed by the project:

         lobsters$ bundle

* Create a MySQL (other DBs supported by ActiveRecord may work, only MySQL and
MariaDB have been tested) database, username, and password and put them in a
`config/database.yml` file.  You will also want a separate database for
running tests:

          development:
            adapter: mysql2
            encoding: utf8mb4
            reconnect: false
            database: lobsters_dev
            socket: /tmp/mysql.sock
            username: *dev_username*
            password: *dev_password*
            
          test:
            adapter: mysql2
            encoding: utf8mb4
            reconnect: false
            database: lobsters_test
            socket: /tmp/mysql.sock
            username: *test_username*
            password: *test_password*

* Load the schema into the new database:

          lobsters$ rake db:schema:load

* Create a `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` file, using a randomly
generated key from the output of `rake secret`:

          Lobsters::Application.config.secret_key_base = 'your random secret here'

* Define your site's name and default domain, which are used in various places,
in a `config/initializers/production.rb` or similar file:

          class << Rails.application
            def domain
              "example.com"
            end
          
            def name
              "Example News"
            end
          end
          
          Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:host] = Rails.application.domain

* Put your site's custom CSS in `app/assets/stylesheets/local`.

* Seed the database to create an initial administrator user and at least one tag:

          lobsters$ rake db:seed
          created user: test, password: test
          created tag: test

* Run the Rails server in development mode.  You should be able to login to
`http://localhost:3000` with your new `test` user:

          lobsters$ rails server

* In production, set up crontab or another scheduler to run regular jobs:

          */5 * * * *  cd /path/to/lobsters && env RAILS_ENV=production sh -c 'bundle exec ruby script/mail_new_activity; bundle exec ruby script/post_to_twitter'
