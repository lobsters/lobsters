<p>
If you don't know (or can't find) an <%= link_to 'existing user', users_tree_path %> from
whom to request an invitation, you can make a public request for one.  This
will display your name and memo to all other logged-in users who can then
send you an invitation if they recognize you.
</p>

<p>
Your e-mail address must be valid and confirmed by visiting a URL e-mailed to
you before your request will be displayed.  Your e-mail address will not be
shown to any other users (except moderators).
</p>

<%= form_with model: @invitation_request, url: create_invitation_by_request_path do |f| %>
  <div class="labelled_grid">
    <%= f.label :name, "Name (not username)" %>
    <%= f.text_field :name %>

    <%= f.label :email, "E-mail Address" %>
    <%= f.email_field :email, inputmode: :email, autocapitalize: :off %>

    <%= f.label :memo, "URL" %>
    <div>
      <%= f.text_field :memo, autocapitalize: :off %>
      <span class="hint">URL to verify you (Personal website, GitHub account, etc.)</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <%= f.submit "Request Invitation" %>
<% end %>
