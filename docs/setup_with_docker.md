# Installation

* Install docker on your machine. Follow the offical guideline on docker.com.
* Create a fork of the repo
* Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/[USER_NAME]/lobsters.git`
* Run `make docker-serve`
  * This will pull a mariadb image and start two containers: one for web and another for the database
* Change the credentials:
  * Create a new terminal tab
  * Run `docker compose run app bash`
  * Run `EDITOR=vim rails credentials:edit`
    * Note: This will open vim in the container
    * Copy content from `config/credentials.yml.enc.sample` and paste it in the vim editor by right clicking on your mouse and clicking paste
    * To save your changes and exit vim press `:` key, type `wq` and press enter
    * You should get a similiar image like this:
   ![sucessful vim](./vim_result.jpg)

* Update `database.yml`
  * Change line 5 to `host: db`
  * Add the below code to yoru development primary and test primary:

```
  username: root
  password: localdev
```

* It should look like something like this:

```
  development:
  primary:
    <<: *trilogy
    database: lobsters_development
    username: root
    password: localdev
```

* Switch back to the tab running the mariadb image and restart the server by:
  * Holding down `control` and `c`
  * Run `make docker-serve`
  * You should see something like this:
  ![server output](./server_output.jpg)
* In another terminal, Run `docker compose run app bin/setup`
* Create the fake data by running `docker compose run app rails fake_data`
  * Note: this will take 2-5 minutes
* Confirm the server is running by navigating to `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

# Common errors

![credential error](./credentials_error.jpg)
Solution: Redo step "Change the credentials":

![foreign key error](./foreign_key_error.jpg)
Solution:

* Run `docker compose run app db:drop`
* Redo steps starting at "Switch back to the tab running the mariadb image and restart the server by:"

# Debugging in Docker

* Open a new terminal
* Run your app server:
  * IF your app server is running, Run `docker attach <CONTAINER_NAME>`
    * Example: `docker attach lobsters-app`
    * You can check if it is running by running `docker ps` and if you see something similiar by the below image, then the app server is running
    ![docker ps](./docker_ps.jpg)
  * IF you app server is not running, Run `docker compose run --rm --service-ports app`
    * `--rm` ensures that you do not create orphaned containers
* Add `byebug` to the file you wish to add a break point and debug.
* Happy debugging!

# Running tests in Docker

* Run `docker compose run app rspec`
