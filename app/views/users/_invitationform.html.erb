Invitations are unlimited, but persons you invite will be associated with your account
in the <%= link_to 'user tree', users_tree_path %>
and you may be responsible for them if they cause problems.
Please use your discretion when inviting persons you don't personally know.

<p>
Note to trans users:
User profiles list the user who invited them.
If you want to avoid connecting your old and new usernames, ask <%= link_to 'a moderator', moderators_path %> to send you an invite.
