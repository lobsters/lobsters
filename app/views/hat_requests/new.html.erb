  A hat is a formal, verified way of speaking officially for a project, organization, or company on Lobsters.
  A user can have more than one hat, but only wear one at a time on a comment or private message.
  </p>
  <p>
  Hats are for making public statements, not commemorating contributions to a project or jobs held.
  Please request one only if you'll be acting offically here, like if you're a core project developer or company employee authorized to post on behalf of your organization.
  Hats are usually reserved for notable projects and organizations.
  </p>
  <p>
  To request a hat for your account, provide a short description of the hat
  (e.g., "OpenBSD Developer"), a public link that will be shown when hovering
  over the hat that users can see, such as your e-mail address at that project
  or company, or a link to a company website showing your employment, and
  private comments that will be seen only by moderators during approval.
  </p>
  <p>
  It's really helpful if you <b>auth your GitHub</b> account from your <%= link_to 'settings', settings_path(anchor: 'external') %>
  and, in your comment below, link to where the organization lists that account.
  Then we can instantly see you're legit without having to send a verification email.
  </p>
  <p>
  When you can no longer speak for a project or company, please contact a moderator to doff your hat.
  Old messages will still show it and you won't be able to use it again.
